The functional requirements of the  LIS system are as follows:
*There should be a feature of issuing a book.
*There should be a system of search functionality according to the title, author etc.
*There should be a system of storing the name of students who have issued any book along with the book name.
*There should be a system like if any student wants to extend the date of return then the system should check if that particular book is pre booked by any other student or not if the book is already pre booked by any other student then the extension should be canceled.
*If a particular student has issued a book and he/she himself/herself is applying for pre-booking again then his/her request should be canceled.
*There should be a system of adding or removing any book as well as updating any book information.
*There should be a system to count the fine each day for the user if he/she forgot to return the book on time.
*The issue or returning of the book should be performed by a valid user who is a member of the LIS system only, so there should be an authentication system provided.
